This is a CLI Pacman game that I coded in C++ for one of my courses. 

To run it, you can use the Makefile to create the executable.   
For Windows:  
Run the command: `make all` from preferred terminal to create the main.exe file.  
For Linux:  
Run the command: `make all` from preferred terminal to create the main.out file.
